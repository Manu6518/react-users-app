# Users List App (React)

A React application for managing users that demonstrates clean state management, API integration, and CRUD operations using a mock backend.
This project focuses on applying React fundamentals with real-world UI patterns rather than complex domain logic.

## Features

- Fetch users from a backend API
- Display users in a responsive list
- Add, Edit, and Delete users
- Confirmation modals and toast notifications
- Loading and error handling
- Clean integration of Bootstrap with React
- Built with React function components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)

## Users List App – Reference Version

I initially built a simpler version of the Users List App:

- Fetched users from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- Used React function components with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Implemented loading state and rendered a read-only list of users

This was my learning version to understand:

- React hooks fundamentals (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Asynchronous API calls
- Component re-render behavior and state updates.

The current version evolves this into a full CRUD application with improved UX and better application structure.
