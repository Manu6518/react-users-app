# Users List App (React)

A simple React app to manage users. Demonstrates fetching data, state management, and CRUD operations with a backend (JSON Server).

## Features

- Fetch users from a backend API
- Display users in a list
- Add, Edit, and Delete users
- Loading and error handling
- Built with React function components and hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Users List App – Reference Version

I initially built a simpler version of the Users List App:

- Fetched users from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- Used React function components with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Implemented loading state and rendered a read-only list of users

This was my learning version to understand:

- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Asynchronous API calls
- Conditional rendering and dynamic list updates

The current version has been upgraded to full CRUD with a backend, error handling, and improved functionality.
